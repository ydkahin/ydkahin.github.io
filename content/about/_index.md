I'm Yohannes, a PhD candidate in Math (expected May, 2024) who is looking to transition into industry. I am open to roles in quantitative/analytics fields. 

I enjoy working on challenging problems, and equally find delight in sharing my solutions to those problems. This is actually part of the reason I maintain a blog where I archive tutorial-like write-ups. 

Thank you for reading!
